Functionality Description:
When hover on the star, you wonâ€™t make the selection. Instead, you have to click to select. To unselect or reset the selection, simply click on any star. 

When you are happy with your decision, click apply button.


For accessibility, you can use tab to navigate some element. As some people may disable image access, here use font awesome instead of images.
